## Musical theory

- [Ableton Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) - A really good tutorial for beginners about rythm, bass,
  melody, composition and so on. Really didactic.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è üìñ [Music for geeks and nerds](https://pedrokroger.net/mfgan/) - Learn music theory though programming exercises!
  For geeks and nerds for sure but not only.
- [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/) - A well-known textbook about music theory.
- [Tunelark](https://www.tunelark.com/) - A website application game to learn music theory.
- [Teoria](http://teoria.com/) - Music theory with exercises.
- [Dave Conservatoire](http://www.daveconservatoire.org/) - Considered by some like the Khan Academy for music.
- [Music Theory for Musicians and Normal People](http://tobyrush.com/theorypages/index.html) - Music theory cheatsheet.

## Blogs

- [Reverb Machine](https://www.reverbmachine.com/articles/) - A lot of deconstructed compositions using Ableton.
- [Samplified US](https://samplified.us/blogs/tutorials-and-free-downloads) - Some good tutorials and hints.
- [Patches Zone](https://patches.zone/) - Good tutorials about Ableton, composition and electronix music.

## Groups

## Tools

### Google experiments

Google did a bunch of really nice experiments [using
MusicVAE]](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/music_vae)
([article](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae)).
